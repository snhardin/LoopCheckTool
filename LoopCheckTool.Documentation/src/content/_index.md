The LoopCheckTool is a Windows application built in .Net for generating a Loop Check Word Document from an Excel IO List. It allows for customization through templatization of different IO Types.

The tool is available as both a CLI tool and as a Windows application. Linux or Mac OS support is not planned at this time, but may be a possibility in the future as .Net Core becomes more mature.

Right now, the tool is quite alpha and unstable, so please [report bugs and request features](https://github.com/snhardin/LoopCheckTool/issues) generously.
