This guide is not a user manual for Microsoft Products. The appropriate help file for Excel or Word should be used as general advice rather than this documentation. However, some concepts behind document manipulation in Word and Excel are very abstract, and need to be explained in detail with pictures for clarification.

All guides in this section assume that the user is using the Desktop version of Office 2019 applications.
