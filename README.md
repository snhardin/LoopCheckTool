# LoopCheckTool
LoopCheckTool is a tool for automatically generating Loop Check documentation from an Excel IO List. It can automatically fill in fields from a set of Microsoft Word templates for each tag and merge all of the resulting templates into one big Microsoft Word file (assuming each tag is a row in the IO List).

The tool is available as both a command line tool and as a Windows application. Linux or Mac OS support is not planned at this time. Currently, the tool is quite alpha, so please feel free to report bugs generously.

For usage, please see the User Guide in the wiki.
