        This tool can be used to fill in Word Document (.DOCX) templates with information
        retrieved from an Excel document. The generated Word Documents are then merged into
        one big document.
        \n\n
        Its intended use is for Loop Check documentation generation. Each IO Type should have
        its own Word Document template in a folder. Your IO List should be in its own Excel file
        and each tag should have its own line.\n
        Using the tool, a Word Document template will be selected for each tag in the IO List.
        This template will be filled in from information retrieved for that tag. Once all tags
        have been processed, one large Word Document will be generated in the end.
